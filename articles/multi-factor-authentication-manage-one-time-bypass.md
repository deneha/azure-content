# One-time bypass in Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
The following document describes how to setup and enable the one-time bypass feature for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. Multi-Factor Authentication can be bypassed to allow a user to authenticate a single time. The bypass is temporary and expires after the specified number of seconds. Use the following procedures to enable a one-time bypass or to revoke a one-time bypass. The following procedures are covered in this document.

## To create a one-time bypass

<ol>
<li>Log on to http://azure.microsoft.com</li>
<li>On the left, select Active Directory.</li>
<li>At the top select Multi-Factor Auth Providers. This will bring up a list of your Multi-Factor Auth Providers.</li>
<li>If you have more than one Multi-Factor Auth Provider, select the one that is associated with the directory for the user you wish to create a one-time bypass for and click Manage at the bottom of the page. If you have only one, just click Manage. This will open the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Management Portal.</li>
