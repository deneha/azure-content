To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

- an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AED8DE357" target="_blank">Azure Free Trial</a>.


- the [Azure Mobile Services Android SDK](http://aka.ms/Iajk6q); 
- the <a  href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">Android Studio integrated development environment</a>, which includes the Android SDK; and Android 4.2 or a later version. The downloaded GetStartedWithData project requires Android 4.2 or a later version. However, the Mobile Services SDK requires only Android 2.2 or a later version. 

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Add Mobile Services to an existing app].

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If you completed the quickstart tutorial prior to the release of Azure Mobile Services Android SDK 2.0, you must re-do it, because the SDK is not backwards compatible. To verify the version, check the **dependencies** section of your project's `build.gradle` file.
